Credits go to:

Obviously the Starbound Dev Team for creating Starbound and making mod creation fairly simple and easy.

Then also my friend Norway174, who is working on his own race mod called "Terran". We two talked quite a bit giving each other ideas.

Hiuki for giving me inspiration to create my own sprite sheet for my mod.
nubnubbud for also giving inspiration.
