Credits go to:

Hiuki for creating the Kazdra Race Mod. Without that mod I wouldn't have the idea of creating my own dragon race. AND for giving me permission to use the Kazdra Animation Set.
Which means that our mods are not the same, two different authors, so also go check out his mod "Kazdra".

Obviously the Starbound Dev Team for creating Starbound.

Then also my friend Norway174, who is working on his own race mod called "Terran". We two talked quite a bit giving each other ideas.
