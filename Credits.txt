Obviously the Starbound Dev Team for creating Starbound and making mod creation fairly simple and easy.

Then also my friend Norway174, who is working on his own race mod called "Terran". We two talked quite a bit giving each other ideas.

And Notnat for providing better graphics for the male and female heads.
