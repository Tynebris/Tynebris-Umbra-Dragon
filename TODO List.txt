Melee
Lightweight: Increases attack speed.
Laser intensity: Increases damage output.

Range
Heat-Venting: Fire rate increase.
Laser Focus: Increases damage output.
Flux Capacitor: Significant decrease in energy usage.

Armor
Starting with Tier5 no modules, but production.
Modules:
SJ > Speed and Jump boost.
Health > Health Increase and Health Regen.
Energy > Energy Increase and Energy Regen.
GA > 50% more armor rating and glowing-effect.
Production:
Lightweight > Like SJ without armor upgrade.
Nanites > Built in nanites for the Armor for health-regeneration.
Thermal Generator > Increased energy-regeneration.
Glowing > Glowing-effect.
Production can be improved with more platings and with better energy-generation for increased armor rating.
Production starts with Tier 5.
