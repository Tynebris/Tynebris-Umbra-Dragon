    "We finally finished our first Dimensional Drive Prototype. Of course this does not come without any questions. Can we return to our dimension, if, then how? We don't even know if it is going to go well or not. It is the prototype after all.",

    "The first test was a success. It worked, but it came with a cost, most of our systems overloaded. It's a catastrophe. We lost many due to the internal and external explosions. We are a small group left.",
	
	"We all have come to agree that we need to spread out. Our ship is going to be left here in cloak, orbiting a moon."
