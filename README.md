# Tynebris-Umbra-Dragon
This is a Starbound race mod which adds a variation of my Umbra Dragons to the game.

### Current Features:
* A dragon looking humanoid, self made (with inspiration from the Kazdra Race Mod - by Hiuki - and by the reptans - by nubnubbud).
* Weapons from tier 1 to tier 10 (Current graphics are from vanilla).
* Armors from tier 1 to tier 10 (Current graphics are from vanilla).
* Two transmutation objects (for the old fuel and new fuel).
* Crafting Station (not used yet) for crafting the armor and weapons.
* Two codices.

### Planned Features:
* Custom spacecraft (Currently the Floran is being used as a template).
* Tiered Firearms (Currently being worked on).
* Custom Respawn Animation.
* Custom Cinematic.
* Armor upgrade/improving.
* More codices, for more lore.
* Custom "village"/"dungeon".
* Vanity armors.
* Spawners.
* At least one own quest.
* Own food.

### Help Wanted
One of my problems are the graphical parts of mods, and if anyone has some spare time or wants to help with the graphical parts, feel free to send me a message.


### Final words
This is not a feature rich (race) mod, and it still is in development. The umbra dragons (this variant - bipedals) is my thought/idea/"vision" of dragons in Starbound. I started working on this mod in the first quarter of November because I did not have graphical assets I could use, now I do.
