# Tynebris-Umbra-Dragon
This is a Starbound race mod which adds a variation of my Umbra Dragons to the game.

### Current Features:
* A humanoid dragon.
* Weapons from tier 1 to tier 10 (Current graphics are from vanilla).
* Armors from tier 1 to tier 10 (Current graphics are from vanilla).
* Two transmutation objects (for the old fuel and new fuel).
* Crafting Station (not used yet) for crafting the armor and weapons.
* Two codices.
* Custom Respawn Animation.

### Planned Features:
* Custom spacecraft (Currently the Floran is being used as a template).
* Tiered Firearms (Currently being worked on).
* Custom Cinematic.
* Armor upgrade/improving.
* More codices, for more lore.
* Custom "village"/"dungeon".
* Vanity armors.
* Spawners.
* At least one own quest.
* Own food.
* Using Erchius Crystal more for than that one quest.

### Help Wanted
One of my problems are the graphical parts of mods, and if anyone has some spare time or wants to help with the graphical parts, feel free to send me a message or post in the discussion tab of the mod.


### Final words
This is not a feature rich (race) mod, and it still is in development. The umbra dragons (this variant - bipedals) is my thought/idea/"vision" of dragons in Starbound. I started working on this mod in the first quarter of November but didn't upload it because I did not have graphical assets I could use, now I do.
